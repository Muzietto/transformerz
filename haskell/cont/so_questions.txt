Trying to exercise with the Cont monad. Syntax issue.

After some study ([1], [2], [3] among others) I am trying to make work of the continuation monad by attempting some examples on my own. I present here a few issues.

The second answer to [1] suggests to express the factorial using continuations. My solution is the following:

    Cont ($ (fact 0)) = return 1
    Cont ($ (fact n)) = Cont ($ (fact (n-1))) >>= (\x -> Cont ($ (n*x)))

I've done some simulations on paper and the solution should be correct.

However I am unable to have it digested by GHC. Of course I renamed the 'fact' function, but still no joy.

My latest attempt is https://gist.github.com/Muzietto/595bef1815ddf375129d
and gives "parse error in pattern \c -> ....."

Can anyone suggest a running implementation for these definitions?
